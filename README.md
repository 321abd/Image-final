# UYG332 Image Processing Final Project

This repository contains the final project submission for the UYG332 Image Processing course. The project aims to demonstrate understanding of core image processing concepts and their application using Python and the OpenCV library.

## Student Information

* Name: Abdulrahman Olabi
* Student ID: B2280.060140

## Project Structure

This repository includes:

* image_final_abdulrahman.ipynb: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file containing all the solutions to the assigned image processing problems.
* README.md: This file, providing an overview and usage instructions.
* The required image dataset (e.g., tf2_engineer.jpg, einstein.tiff, pout.tiff, moon.tiff, pcb.tiff, pollen.tiff) should be present in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Use the Jupyter Notebook

To run and interact with the project notebook, follow these steps:

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

* Python 3.x: The programming language used for all tasks.
* Jupyter Notebook: The environment where the project solutions are presented.

### Libraries

The following Python libraries are essential and must be installed:

* OpenCV (opencv-python): The primary library for image processing tasks.
* NumPy: Used for numerical operations, especially with image arrays.
* Matplotlib: Used for plotting and displaying images within the notebook.

### Running the Notebook

* Clone the Repository (or download):
    If you're using Git, clone this repository to your local machine:
        git clone (https://github.com/321abd/Image-final.git)
        cd .\Image-final.git\
* Place Image Dataset:
    Make sure the image files provided for the project are located in the same directory as the image_final_abdulrahman.ipynb file
* Start Jupyter Notebook:
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the project files, and run:
        jupyter notebook
* Open the Notebook:
    Your web browser will open, showing the Jupyter Dashboard. Click on image_final_abdulrahman.ipynb to open the project notebook.
* Run Cells:
    Once the notebook is open, you can run all cells by selecting Cell > Run All from the top menu.

You can install mentioned libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter opencv-python numpy matplotlib
