Problem 1: Picture Center and Color Box

What to do:
    1.  Look at the `tf2_engineer.jpg` picture. Show it in full color. 
    2.  Find the middle point of this picture. Tell us what color or brightness is at that exact middle point. 
    3.  Put a small, colored square box right in the middle of the picture. The box is 30 pixels tall and 40 pixels wide. The color of this box is a special blue-green (#329ea8). 
    4.  Tell us what color or brightness is now at the middle of this new colored box. 
    5.  Show the picture with the new colored box. 

Why: We do this operation to check if we capatured points in a specific image and draw in it.

Problem 2: Darker Version of Picture

What to do:
    1.  Look at the `einstein.tiff` picture. Show it in black and white (grayscale). 
    2.  Make a "negative" of this picture. This means dark parts become bright, and bright parts become dark. 
    3.  Show this negative picture. 
    4.  Pick 5 random tiny spots (pixels) on the first picture. See their brightness. Then, look at the same 5 spots on the negative picture and see their brightness. Show that they are opposite. 

Why: this operation is used to reverse an image colors.

Problem 3: Light Changes (Log Transform)

What to do:
    1.  Look at the `pout.tiff` picture. Show it in black and white. 
    2.  Change the light in the picture using something called "log transform." Show the new picture. 
    3.  Change the light in the *original* picture using "inverse log transform." Show this new picture. 
    4.  Now, take the picture from step 2 (the "log transform" one) and apply "inverse log transform" to it. Show this picture. 
    5.  Tell us what you see when you compare the picture from step 2 and the picture from step 4. Are they similar? What did the changes do? 

Why: This operation is used to use special methods to enhance the image brightness especially dark areas.

Problem 4: Sharpening Pictures

What to do:
    1.  Look at the `moon.tiff` picture. Show it in black and white. 
    2.  Make the picture sharper using a method called "unsharp masking" in a normal way (spatial domain). You need to try this with three different "k" numbers (you pick them). 
    3.  Make the picture sharper using "unsharp masking" in a different way (frequency domain). You must use the *same* three "k" numbers as in step 2. You also need to pick a special number called "D0" for this. 
    4.  For each "k" number, show the sharpened picture from step 2 next to the sharpened picture from step 3. 

Why: this operation is used to do the image clearer and sharper.

Problem 5: Finding and Fixing Bad Spots (Noise)

What to do:
    1.  Look at the `pcb.tiff` picture. Show it in black and white.
    2.  Look closely or use a simple chart (histogram) to figure out what kind of "bad spots" (noise) are in the picture. Is it like tiny white and black dots (salt-and-pepper) or blurry fuzz (Gaussian)? 
    3.  Use the right computer tools (filters) to remove these bad spots. 

Why: This operation is used to detect problems and clean them.

Problem 6: Fix the Picture Problem

What to do:
    1.  Look at the `pollen.tiff` picture. Show it in black and white. 
    2.  Tell us what is wrong with this picture. Show us why you think so (using numbers, how it looks, or charts). 
    3.  Use two *different* ways to fix the problem in the picture. 
    4.  Show the picture after you fix it with each way. 
    5.  For each way you fixed it, tell us *why* it worked. Show us proof (using numbers, how it looks, or charts) that it's better now. 

Why: this operation is to detect problems and clean them up in different ways using only things we took in class
